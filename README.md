## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **AI Model:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling.
-   **Markdown Parsing:** [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) & [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) for secure rendering.
-   **Deployment:** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## ü§î How It Works

The AI does **not** read the entire source code of the repository. Instead, it performs a high-level analysis based on publicly available metadata such as:
- The repository's README file.
- Project description and topics.
- File and folder structure (e.g., `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `Dockerfile`).
- Common conventions for the identified technology stack.

This approach provides a powerful and fast initial assessment, perfect for quickly understanding a new project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run this project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/pricing).

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
    cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    This project is configured to run directly in the browser without a build step. You will need to manually create a file to provide your API key.
    
    > **Note:** This method is for development only. Do not expose your API key in a public repository. The live version of this app should use a backend proxy to protect the key.

    - Create a new file named `env.js` in the root of the project.
    - Add the following content to `env.js`:
      ```javascript
      window.process = {
        env: {
          API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'
        }
      };
      ```
    - Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key.

3.  **Include the environment file:**
    Open `index.html` and add this script tag inside the `<head>` section, *before* the other scripts:
    ```html
    <script src="env.js"></script>
    ```
    
4.  **Open in Browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or using a simple local server extension like "Live Server" in VS Code.
